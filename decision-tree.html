				<p>If you do not meet these core requirements, you may not be able to bring this case to the CCB. While some issues can be fixed (e.g. you wait until your quota for claims with the CCB resets), many of these cannot be changed (e.g. your statute of limitations has run out).

				<p>You may want to look more into whether another venue like federal court might be right for you instead.</p>
				<p>If your issue involves something like misrepresentation or infringement, you may also consider working with internet service providers like Spotify, Etsy, Instragram, YouTube, etc. to correct any issues with their own processes.</p>

			<div class="dt-section" id="q2-eligibility">
				<div class="dt-h2">Is your claim something the CCB has the authority to govern?</div class="dt-h2">

				<p>The CCB can only hear the following kinds of claims:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>infringement</li>
					<li>noninfringement</li>
					<li>misrepresentation</li>
				</ul>

				<p>If your dispute is about a contractual disagreement (e.g. you licensed your content to someone else based on a contract that you believe was violated), this might be out of the CCB's jurisdiction. Learn more about <a href="https://ccb.gov/handbook/Unsuitability.pdf">Unsuitability here</a>.</p>

			<div class="dt-section" id="q2-dead-end">
				<div class="dt-h2">üõë The CCB might not be right for you.</div class="dt-h2">

				<p>The CCB has limited authority to govern over only specific copyright cases. Read more <a href="https://ccb.gov/handbook/Introduction.pdf">about the CCB here</a>, to learn more.</p>
				<p>You may want to look more into whether another venue like federal court might be right for you instead. One common reason cases do not survive in the CCB's compliance review process (when the officers review your claim after it is filed) is that they are not actually copyright disputes. If a case is fundamentally about a dispute on whether a contract was breached (e.g. a contract involving the licensing of copyrighted materials), that actually would not be within the CCB's jurisdiction. This is the kind of case you might instead consider bringing to a federal court.</p>
			</div>




			<div class="dt-section" id="q3-claim-type">
				<div class="dt-h2">What kind of claim are you pursuing?</div class="dt-h2">

				<p>As a reminder, the CCB only oversees these three types of claims:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Infringement: </strong>
						You may have an infringement claim if you believe that someone used your original and protected work. To bring a CCB infringement claim, you must (1) have a registered copyright for your work, (2) maintain exclusive rights over the work, and (3) someone else attempted to use your exclusive rights without your permission.
					</li>
					<li><strong>Noninfringement: </strong>
						These claims are relevant if someone accuses you of unlawfully using or intending to use their protected work without permission. A noninfringement claim can give you a declaration from the CCB that your conduct is not (nor will be) copyright infringement. You do not need a registered copyright to bring a noninfringement claim.
					</li>
					<li><strong>Misrepresentation: </strong>
						If ‚Äúyou believe the respondent said something false in a takedown notice or counter-notice to an online service provider, and this resulted in the online service provider taking content offline or putting it back online,‚Äù then you have a misrepresentation claim.

				<p>After your file your claim and pay your first filing fee ($40), the CCB will review it. As noted above, many claims do not make it past this review process. Claims that are not fundamentally about copyright law issues or claims that are <a href="https://ccb.gov/handbook/Unsuitability.pdf">not eligible</a> do not continue.</p>

				<p><strong>What happens if your claim doesn't succeed on the first try?</strong>If the issue that came up is something that can be corrected, for example you needed to provide more information about something in your claim, the CCB provides two chances to make corrections (called "amendments").

			<div class="dt-section" id="q7-service">
				<div class="dt-h2">Do you complete service of the claim?</div class="dt-h2">

				<div class="callout box">Note: Between June 16, 2022 to February 6, 2024, only 361 parties filed a valid proof service from the 721 total claims initially filed.</div>

				<p>The CCB will provide you with a packet of information you must present to the respondent. This process is called service. You cannot include any other materials when sending this packet ‚Äî a proper service packet includes an initial notice, the claim, and the opt-out form. You can also give your respondent the option to waive service. If the respondent agrees to waive, you do not need to serve them.</p>

				<p>Service can be challenging in the filing process because each state has its own service rules. How service is accomplished will depend ‚Äúon who the respondent is, where they are located, and whether they have a designated service agent.‚Äù The CCB advises that some claimants may want to consider hiring a process server who can sign a form confirming the service of the process. You can issue service by the CCB‚Äôs designated methods or serve based on the applicable state law where the respondent lives. Importantly, you cannot serve the respondent yourself. A general rule to keep in mind is that if you are serving in person, you may not be the one to personally serve the documents. </p>
				
				<p>Once you serve the respondent, you will need to share evidence of service with the CCB within seven days of service. You have 90 days to issue service and file proof of service.</p>

				<div class="callout box">Note: Between June 16, 2022 to February 6, 2024, 75 respondents opted out. 109 claimants paid their second filing fee, reaching active phase.</div>

				<p>Something unique about the CCB is that respondents can choose not to participate in the process. If a respondent does not respond at all when they are given service, they are automatically opted-in to the proceedings by default. But, if a respondent does choose to opt-out, that marks the end of the claim.</p>

				<p>Respondents might opt-in by default by not responding, or they may choose to participate in the CCB's process because here, there are limits on damages and the proceedings are more streamlined. But some respondents may prefer to opt-out, instead. If the respondent opts in, you will need to submit a second payment of $60 to the CCB to push your case into "active phase."</p>
				
				<p>If a respondent opts out, that doesn't mean you have no recourse. You can try to reach a settlement with the respondent, or you can still bring your claim to federal court where there is not choice to opt out. This may be a more difficult path for claimants (it's harder to navigate, may be much harder without an attorney, and is more drawn out), but may lead to more damages if you believe the respondent willfully infringed on your copyrighted materials.</p>

				<p>Once active, the CCB will issue an order directing you, the claimant, to pay a second filing fee of $60 on eCCB within fourteen days. Your proceeding will be delayed if you don‚Äôt submit the second filing fee on time.</p>

				<p>Next, the CCB will issue a Scheduling Order. It will include key dates and deadlines for each stage of this active phase. The respondent will explain their positions by filing a response and any counterclaims.</p>

				<p><strong>Prediscovery</strong> ‚Ä¢ You and your Copyright Claims Officer will meet in a virtual conference to discuss the process of presenting your case. The officer is one of the three officers who make up the CCB tribunal. Once again, they have deep experience in copyright law. They will hold a virtual conference with you and the respondent to discuss the proceeding, how the steps of the proceeding will work, and whether or not you are interested in settling.</p>

				<p><strong>Discovery</strong> ‚Ä¢ After your pre-discovery conference, you will enter discovery. During this period, the parties exchange information and documents relevant to the claim. Once the discovery period ends, a Copyright Claims Officer holds another virtual conference to discuss the process of presenting your case to the CCB. They may again discuss whether you are interested settling.</p>

				<p><strong>Hearings</strong> ‚Ä¢ If you and the respondent decide you don‚Äôt want to settle, you will present your case in a remote digital hearing in the form of a) a written position statement describing why you think you should win, b) a statement from any witnesses, and c) documentary evidence.</p>

				<p>If you've gotten this far, your claim may reach a final determination! This does not happen often - many parties may drop out of the process because they independently reached a settlement. This may not be reflected in the data about the CCB - sometimes, claimants voluntarily dismiss their own cases or stop responding within the required deadlines because they and the respondent have made agreements outside of the CCB's process. This isn't necessarily a bad thing -- settlements can be a way of achieving your desired outcome without leveraging the CCB or federal courts.</p>

				<p>Final determinations are legally "final" -- they are official decisions, that have legal effect. But if you disagree with these decisions and want someone to review them, you can file for review. The CCB must grant your request for review, so this is not guaranteed.</p>
