				<h1>What is copyright?</h1>

				<p>Imagine you spend hours painting a beautiful landscape—after weeks of work, you upload an image of your painting to share with the world in your online portfolio. A few days later, you see a copy of your painting sold as a print on an online marketplace. Have your intellectual property rights been violated?</p>

				<p>Intellectual property refers to creations of the mind, such as inventions and artistic works [ ]. Intellectual property rights allow individuals to protect their work by preventing others from reproducing or exploiting their intellectual creations [ ]. Intellectual property rights include copyrights, patents, trademarks, and design rights [2]. We’re focusing on copyright here.</p>

				<p>Copyright is “the body of law that deals with the ownership and use of works of literature, music, and art.”[ ] The basic purpose of copyright is to “enrich our society's wealth of culture and information.”[3] Congress draws power from the US Constitution to enact copyright laws to “promote the progress of science and useful arts[.]”[ ] Because more than one person can share intellectual property simultaneously, copyright law helps protect artistic labor by creating a boundary around what is and isn’t for the artist to own. In this way, copyright law promotes innovation because artists know they can be paid for their work. Copyrights eventually expire if not renewed, returning works to the public domain [20].</p>


				<br>
				<h3>Copyright is different from Copyright Registration</h3>
				<p>Copyright is established as soon as your expressive work is complete, but registering a copyright gives your work special legal protections.</p>

				<h4>Copyright Upon Fixation</h4>
				<span class="blue">The right to register a work for copyright</span>

				<p>Today, creators earn a copyright upon fixation after completing their work.  Creators’ works are automatically copyrighted upon “fixation” [ ]. To qualify for fixation, a work must be:</p>

				<ol>
					<li>fixed in a tangible medium of expression (e.g. a musical work on a record),</li>
					<li>perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated, either directly or with the aid of a machine or device [5].</li>
				</ol>

				<p>Thinking back to the landscape painting example—the work is fixed as soon as you finish the painting. At that moment, you earn a copyright over the work.</p>

				<p>With fixation, you gain the right to register for a copyright to protect it. Beyond that, copyrights alone do not establish legal protections. This is why the U.S. Copyright Office recommends that creators still register their work for copyright to publicly record their ownership status [ ].</p>
				
				
				<h4>Copyright Registration</h4>
				<span class="blue">The right to legally defend your work</span>
				
				<p>Unlike copyrights upon fixation, copyright registration creates legal benefits.   You cannot bring a claim or litigate an issue of copyright without registering your copyright.  Upon fixation, you gain the right to register for copyright, but you do not necessarily earn the right to defend your copyright legally without registration. You must have a registered copyright to bring infringement claims and seek monetary relief through the legal system. This is the key distinction between copyright and copyright registration [6].

				<br>
				<h4>How do you register for a copyright?</h4>
				<p>Applying for registration requires an application, a filing fee ($65), and a copy of the work (which the Office calls a “deposit”) [ ], [22]. You can bring a claim by filing a complaint to a federal court or by filing your claim online with the Copyright Claims Board. Once again, you can copyright many different forms of art. These forms of art include digital art (like photography), physical art (like painting or sculpture), and musical works (like musical composition). Before looking at how to bring a claim at the CCB, let’s look more closely at some terms you may want to familiarize yourself.</p>
				<br>

				<div class="box">
					<div class="box-subtitle">Copyright at a glance</div>
						<ul>
							<li>Works gain copyrights once they are "fixed" in a tangible expressive medium.</li>
							<li>Copyrights alone do not create legal rights.</li>
							<li>Registered copyrights establish legal rights - when a work with a registered copyright is infringed, you can defend your rights in the legal system.</li>
							<li>You are required to have copyright registration or pending copyright registration for works you seek to defend with infringement claims with the CCB.</li>

				<h1>What is the Copyright Claims Board (CCB)?</h1>

				<p>In December 2020, the Copyright Alternative in Small-Claims Enforcement Act of 2020 (CASE Act) endowed the Copyright Office with the power to establish the Copyright Claims Board (called the “CCB”) [ ]. The CCB was established by the federal government with the goal of expanding “access to justice” making “the copyright system as understandable and accessible to as many members of the public as possible.” [ ]</p>

				<p>The CCB is the Copyright Office’s approach to resolving copyright disputes online. Three presiding officers, each with deep expertise in copyright law, make case determinations and lead the CCB. Court hearings and proceedings are conducted fully online, removing the barrier to entry that can occur when proceedings occur in court. The CCB is designed for claimants to navigate without an attorney, though you are welcome to hire one. Although litigants can represent themselves in federal court, some may find this easier to do in the CCB’s claim process.</p>

				<p>The CCB sees all kinds of copyright cases. As of 2023, the most common claims were for pictorial, graphic, or sculptural works. Architectural claims (e.g. based on an architectural firm’s design of a home) were the least common.</p>

				<br>
				<img src="assets/CCB-pie-chart.svg" alt="A pie chart showing the distribution of types of work represented in CCB claims between 6/16/2022 to 10/31/2022" />
				<div class="caption">This chart is based on data provided by the Library of Congress [ ].</div>
				<br>

				<p>Unlike federal court, the CCB’s jurisdiction is limited to claims of copyright infringement, claims seeking declarations that specific activities do not infringe copyright; and claims of “misrepresentation” in notices sent under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).</p>

				<p>Notably, participation in the CCB is also fully voluntary. While a claimant may raise a valid argument, respondents can decide whether to participate in CCB proceedings (more on this later). If a respondent chooses to opt out, a claimant can still bring a lawsuit against that respondent in federal court.</p>

				<p>If a respondent files a counterclaim, it must be related to the original claim. Counterclaims are also limited to the types of claims in the CCB’s jurisdiction and must arise from the same “transaction or occurrence” (the same facts and circumstances) as the original claim.</p>

				<p>Neither party can bring a claim before the CCB seeking more than $30,000 in total damages (more on this later, as well!).</p>

			<div class="section"  id="ccb-flowchart">
				<h2>Could the CCB be right for you?</h2>
				<p>The CCB is one among a few options you have to legally defend your intellectual property. The CCB's process is different from that of federal courts, and comes with its own eligibility requirements. </p>
				<img src="assets/CCB-flowchart.svg" alt="a flowchart of questions stepping through considerations a person might have when considering bringing a claim with the CCB" />
			</div>

			<div class="section"  id="ccb-tradeoffs">
				<h2>What are the tradeoffs of filing with the CCB?</h2>
				<p>There are some advantages and disadvantages to filing with the CCB as opposed to filing in federal court. Consider the following when you consider your claim:</p>
				<h4>👍 ADVANTAGES</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>There is no attorney required.
						<ul>
							<li>You can avoid attorney’s fees by filing with the CCB.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>The CCB is a more approachable court system.
					<ul>
						<li>The CCB is entirely online, and there are some advantages to a digital court system. There are text boxes to input information in the CCB’s online forms.</li>
						<li>This helps you to figure out the information you need to file a claim and navigate court proceedings.</li>
					</ul></li>
					<li>There is a low filing fee—filing your claim and proceedings to an active case require $40 and $60, respectively.</li>
					<li>The administration is fully remote, negotiating travel costs and conflicts with other commitments.</li>
					<li>Decisions are made by a panel of experts on copyright who focus primarily on these cases.</li>
				</ul>

				<h4>👎 DISADVANTAGES</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>There is no attorney required.
					<ul>
						<li>Filing alone can sometimes be confusing, and it is important to remember that you need enough evidence to support a viable claim. This can be easier with the help of an attorney who can guide you through the process. Remember that you can also file with the CCB with an attorney.</li>
					</ul></li>
					<li>Damages are limited to $30,000 per proceeding.</li>
					<li>Respondents may not agree to litigate via the CCB.</li>
					<li>Evidence to support your claim must be captured digitally.
					<ul>
						<li>To create a compelling claim, you need to capture all your communications and images digitally and in a format that will help the CCB officers assess your claim.</li>
					</ul></li>
				</ul>
			</div>

			<div class="section" id="ccb-eligibility">
				<h2>Is your claim eligible for the CCB?</h2>
				<p>Filing a successful claim with the CCB may not be as easy as it seems. Review the list below to determine if the CCB is right for you. All the following must be true for you to be eligible to bring a claim, in general:Filing a successful claim with the CCB may not be as easy as it seems.

				<ul class="checkbox-list">
					<li><input type="checkbox" checked>You and your respondent live in the United States.<br>

						<span class="blue">Note: Respondents can opt out of CCB proceedings. If they opt out, you can refile in federal court either by yourself (as a pro se litigant) or with an attorney.</span>
					</li>
				</ul>
				

				<h4>DAMAGES & SETTLEMENTS</h4>
				<p>When you file a claim, you’ll need to indicate the compensation you are owed. The list below summarizes some issues to consider:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>The CCB only allows for actual or statutory damages. If you think you have a better chance of seeking higher damages in federal court, then the CCB may not be your best option.</li>
					<li>If you are seeking damages under $5,000, you may want to consider filing under a simplified CCB “Smaller Claims” track. This track will involve only one presiding officer, who plays a more prominent role in the case. The CCB published a helpful table highlighting the key differences between this track and the default track in its handbook for Smaller Claims (Page 3).</li>
					<li>A claimant bringing an infringement claim can seek an award of actual damages and the infringer’s profits, statutory damages, or no damages. The claimant must choose which type of awards they are seeking before the Board makes its final determination, and they should do this no later than when the claimant submits their written testimony in the proceeding. Statutory damages are capped at $15,000 per infringed work (not per infringement) or $7,500 if the work wasn’t registered in a timely manner (as described below under “Statutory Damages”).  For more information on damages, see the CCB book on statutory damages.</li>
					<li>If you choose to participate in CCB-facilitated settlement discussions, a Copyright Claims Officer other than the one handling the day-to-day aspects of the proceeding will be assigned to assist you at a settlement conference. For more information on settlements, see the CCB handbook on settlements (Page 4).</li>
				</ul>

					<tr>
						<td class="terminology-term">Infringement </td>
						<td class="terminology-definition">
							You may have an infringement claim if you believe that someone used your original and protected work. To bring a CCB infringement claim, you must (1) have a registered copyright for your work, (2) maintain exclusive rights over the work, and (3) someone else attempted to use your exclusive rights without your permission.<br><br>
							<span class="blue">Example: You independently released a song (this is fixation) on SoundCloud a few years ago and registered it for copyright protection with the US Copyright Office.

						<td class="terminology-term">Noninfringement</td>
						<td class="terminology-definition">
							These claims are relevant if someone accuses you of unlawfully using or intending to use their protected work without permission. A noninfringement claim can give you a declaration from the CCB that your conduct is not (nor will be) copyright infringement. You do not need a registered copyright to bring a noninfringement claim.<br><br>
							<span class="blue">Example: You wrote a play about a farmer’s plight that will soon be performed at a local theater and have not yet registered your work with the Copyright Office.

					<p>After you file a claim, a few things need to happen before the respondent is made aware of your claim. The CCB will review your claim to make sure it complies with the Copyright Claims Act, to which the CCB is bound, and follows CCB’s policies. Your claim must also be substantial enough for a respondent to answer. Many cases do not make it past compliance review. The CCB might review your filing for the following:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Does your case present a copyright issue relevant to the CCB’s scope?<ol>
							<li>The CCB mentions in its guidance that cases that are fundamentally about contractual disagreements are not within scope SOURCE: compliance review handbook p3</li></ol>
							<li>Is your <a href="#ccb-eligibility">claim eligible?</a></li>
							<li>Are you asking for the kind of relief that the CCB can provide?<ol>
								<li>The damages you seek do not exceed $30,000.</li>
								<li>You are not asking the CCB to issue an injunction.</li>
								<li>If you are filing a noninfringement claim, you are not requesting monetary relief.</li>
							</ol></li>
							<li>Did you provide a detailed “statement of material facts”? (More on this below!)</li>
							<li>Is the party necessary to the proceeding available?</li>
						</li>
					</ol>
					<p>If your claim passes compliance review, the CCB will issue a Notice of Compliance and Direction to Serve, taking you to the next step. If not, you will be notified about what is missing in your filing and have 30 days to amend it. If the amended claim still does not pass compliance after a second look, you will have one more opportunity to amend and refile within 30 days.</p>
					<p>If this claim does not pass compliance review at this point, the CCB will dismiss your case without prejudice, but you can still re-file the same claim in the future. This means you can re-submit your claim to the CCB, and it will be considered again if you submit a new claim.</p>

Service can be challenging in the filing process because each state has its own service rules. It may be difficult for some participants to begin the process digitally but remember that service needs to be done in person and over mail. How service is accomplished will depend “on who the respondent is, where they are located, and whether they have a designated service agent.” The CCB advises that some claimants may want to consider hiring a process server who can sign a form confirming the service of the process.</p>
					<p>You can issue service by the CCB’s designated methods or serve based on the applicable state law where the respondent lives. You can also give your respondent the option to waive service. If the respondent agrees to waive, you do not need to serve them. For more on how to serve respondents, visit the CCB’s service recommendations at SOURCE.</p>

				<div class="ccb-stage-collapsible-content" id="ccb-stage-7">
					<p>A determination concludes an active proceeding and explains the basis for the CCB’s decision. The CCB’s determination of your claim is called the “final determination,” but if you aren’t satisfied with a determination, you can seek reconsideration by the CCB, and if that is denied, you may request a review by the Register of Copyrights. You do not need an attorney for any of these proceedings.</p>
					<p>A CCB determination is the CCB’s decision as to who wins the case and the damages to award, if any. It is in writing and includes an explanation of the facts and laws the CCB relied on to make the decision. Importantly, if the losing party does not comply with the determination, it can be enforced in federal court.</p>
					<p>After a determination or an amended determination, each party has thirty days to submit a request to the CCB to reconsider or modify its determination. There is no filing fee for that request. When a request for reconsideration is made, the other parties have thirty days to file a response. Requests for reconsideration cannot be filed by a respondent or counterclaim respondent who defaulted and did not respond to the CCB’s proposed default determination (which would turn the proposed default determination into a final determination).</p>

				<h2>What makes a claim strong?</h2>
				<p>While the CCB’s filing forms will guide you through this process, there are some fields that you may want to consider more carefully. The strength of your claim is generally evaluated based on whether you can prove each element of that claim – you must satisfy all the elements of the claim to prevail in your case. The CCB’s presiding officers will look at the evidence submitted and the cases you make to determine whether you have satisfied these elements. You will also need to show the officers that you will be able to prove each element of your claim to survive compliance review [11].  Remember to answer these questions about how you can support each element when drafting a claim.</p>

				<h4>Infringement Claims</h4>
				<table class="claims-table">

				<h4>Noninfringement Claims</h4>
				
				<p>Noninfringement claims are very similar to infringement claims, but with one key difference: you need to prove that you and the respondent are in a genuine dispute over whether there is infringement. If you can prove this, the respondent's burden will fall on them to prove every element of infringement outlined above. </p>
				
				<p>The elements in this case do not map exactly onto the types of evidence you may want to present, but note the elements first before reviewing types of evidence:</p>

				<h4>Misrepresentation Claims</h4>
				<p>You can bring a claim of misrepresentation before the CCB “if you believe the respondent said something false in a takedown notice or counter-notice to an online service provider, and this resulted in the online service provider taking content offline or putting it back online.” Review the following examples of evidence to try to build a strong claim:</p>

						<td>Element</td>
						<td>Key Questions</td>
						<td>Key Evidence</td>
						<td>Example Evidence</td>
					</thead>
					<tr>
						<td class="claims-table-col-1">

				<h2>Where do claimants go wrong?</h2>

				<p>Certain points along the way to filing a CCB claim and pleading your case can be challenging because it can require remembering that your claim is active and thinking through forms of evidence. Remember to keep track of deadlines and state a viable claim. Keep in mind that the CCB officer will not know anything about your case outside of what you tell them, and they need concrete evidence to believe your story.</p>

				<p>Review the checklist below to avoid common pitfalls in the CCB process:</p>
				<ul class="checkbox-list">
					<li><input type="checkbox" checked>Include a detailed description of your claim and how it fulfills each element, with screenshots and digital evidence supporting each assertion.</li>
					<li><input type="checkbox" checked>If you amend and refile, submit your refile by the deadline in your scheduling order.</li>
					<li><input type="checkbox" checked>Serve your respondent the materials given to you by the CCB and check the service rules in your respondent's state to ensure compliance with the specific service rules.<br>
					<class="blue">Remember that your service will not comply if:</class="blue">
					<ul>
						<li>You or an involved party delivered a copy of the materials.</li>
						<li>You included other materials in the service packet.</li>
						<li>Your service did not comply with the CCB’s requirements, nor applicable state law where the respondent lives. </li>
						<li>You filed for a waiver of service, and the respondent did not opt for the waiver. You did not issue service afterward or missed the deadline at this point.</li>
						<li>You do not have all the required materials in the service packet.</li>
						<li>You missed a deadline (must file proof of service within seven days of issuing notice, and complete all of this within 90 days from  CCB’s Direction to Serve)</li>
					</ul></li>
					<li><input type="checkbox" checked>Pay the second filing fee of $60 within twenty-eight days (after fourteen days, a second fourteen-day order is issued). </li>

				<h2>Special Considerations: Generative AI</h2>
					<p>Copyright has changed dramatically with new technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Nonfungible Tokens (NFTs). Because AI can easily copy the work of another source, and NFTs are intangible goods that can easily be copied, these technologies raise new copyright law issues.</p>
					<p>If you feel that any of these technologies have infringed on your work or choose to use them in your work, you might want to consider a few things before bringing your claim to the CCB. This area of the law is evolving and subject to change.</p>

					<h4>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE & ART</h4>
					<p>Artificial intelligence tools, like DALL-E or Midjourney, are trained on images from around the world. If you have posted images of your art online, AI tools have likely used these images to develop and create new images.
					If you see an image from AI that looks like a work you created, you may feel that the AI tool infringed your copyright. In our current copyright climate, AI companies may argue that their AI-based images are “fair use” and do not infringe copyright protection [17].</p>

					<p>If you think of using AI to create new artwork, you may struggle to register the generated work. The Copyright Office believes that AI is not human and does not deserve copyright protection [16], [17]. Your AI artwork might lose copyright protections.</p>

					<p>While the current copyright landscape for AI may seem bleak, it is important to remember that the Copyright Office has adapted many policies over the 20th and 21st centuries to accommodate new forms of technology. It may only be a matter of years before the office begins to recognize AI’s impact on copyright law. One of the issues for the office may be the confluence of ideas and expression. For example, does a creator own the text they input into an AI image generator? If cases continue to raise issues related to AI and copyright, it might force the office to reconsider how AI is understood.</p>

					<br><br>
					<h4>NFTS & THE BLOCKCHAIN</h4>

					<p>Like AI art, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) form a complicated copyright portrait. You may want to bring a claim of infringement if you sold an NFT and did not transfer the copyright ownership to your buyer or if you bought an NFT and owned the copyright, but the creator continues to license the image. Ownership “over the intellectual property of an NFT is not always clearly defined” [22]. When an NFT is minted or sold, “a blockchain’s smart contract will automatically execute the transfer of ownership, including any rules applicable to the NFT like terms of purchase or resale opportunities” [22]. This “often means that when an NFT is traded, a license that informs collectors about what they can and can’t do with their new asset goes along with it” [22]. As legal scholars James Grimmelmann, Yan Ji, and Tyler Kell claim:</p>
						<p class="quote-block">"If you buy an oil painting from an artist, you don’t also receive ownership of the copyright. Yes, you own the original, but the artist retains the copyright, and they can sell prints of it if they like. If you want to buy the copyright too, you’ll need to get a separate agreement. The same is true for NFTs. Unless an NFT explicitly gives owners copyright interests as opposed to just access to the artwork, owners should not assume that they have any rights to use the artwork or to stop others from using it [21]."</p>

					<p>Individuals who seek to sell NFT artwork should also consider whether they seek to sell the copyright of their work. They might want to only give holders the rights to “use, copy and display” the NFT, for example. If you are the creator of an NFT, and you sold your work, you need to remember that the sale of your work does not automatically transfer copyrights. When selling your NFT, include or not include a sale of the copyright. Once again, simply because your NFT was sold does not necessarily give owners the right to copy your work.</p>
