				<h4>Foreword</h4>

				<p>The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cciarts.org/index.html">Center for Cultural Innovation (CCI)</a> was founded in 2001 to help level the playing field for individual artists by providing them with knowledge, networks, and financial tools to strengthen their self-sufficiency and creative independence. Since 2002, we have expanded and evolved our work to include Advocacy and the advancement of efforts that improve the conditions of artists and arts workers.</p>

				<p>CCI approaches its advocacy work through the framework of power, opportunity, and protections. What upstream policy issues can we reimagine to ensure power is equally distributed, especially to those who have historically been disempowered? How can our efforts provide equal opportunities to artists, regardless of their background? And especially in the case of the Guide, how are we guaranteeing artists a sense of protection of their livelihood, culture, and dignity as vital participants in our society? </p>

				<p>With this framing, we are focused not only on passing and reforming policy but also on ensuring its implementation is working as it was intended. The Copyright Claims Board Guide was developed out of this desire: to hold new policy and public resources accountable for what they were designed to do and to center the voices and needs of those they were designed to bring justice to.</p>

				<p>CCI’s work is only possible because of our dedicated community and partnerships. Helping to turn the Guide into a reality were the amazing students and staff of Stanford University’s Juelsgaard Intellectual Property and Innovation Clinic, including:</p>
				<span class="indented">Phil Malone, <span class="gray">Clinic Director</span></span><br>
				<span class="indented">Nina Srejovic, <span class="gray">Clinical Supervising Attorney and Lecturer</span></span><br>
				<span class="indented">Caitlin Cary Burke, <span class="gray">Certified Clinical Law Student</span></span><br>
				<span class="indented">Kiran Wattamwar, <span class="gray">Certified Clinical Law Student</span></span><br>

				<p>The Guide would also not have been possible without the support of the William & Flora Hewlett Foundation and the Kenneth Rainin Foundation, as well as the hard work and dedication of the CCI team involved in stewarding this partnership:</p>
				<span class="indented">Laura Poppiti, <span class="gray">Deputy Director</span></span><br>
				<span class="indented">Jennelyn Tumalad Bailon, <span class="gray">Senior Program Associate</span></span><br>
				<span class="indented">Jessica Mele, Principal, <span class="gray">Jessica Mele Creative</span></span><br>

				<p>To all who have helped CCI advance the cause of artists, cultural producers, and arts workers, thank you.</p>

				<h2>About the guide</h2>

				<p>Maybe you are a creator who feels their work was copied and wants to set things right. Maybe you recently received a claim that you copied someone else’s work. Or maybe you’re just curious about the Copyright Claims Board (CCB).</p>
				<p>Regardless of what brought you here, this document is a starting point and a guide for creators. This guide helps you navigate the CCB, but it is not comprehensive, and there will be moments when outside resources are pointed to for additional guidance.</p>

			<div class="section" id="what-is-copyright">
				<h1>What is copyright?</h1>

				<p><span class="blue">Imagine you spend hours painting a beautiful landscape—</span>after weeks of work, you upload an image of your painting to share with the world in your online portfolio. A few days later, you see a copy of your painting sold as a print on an online marketplace. Have your intellectual property rights been violated?</p>

				<p><span class="blue">Intellectual property refers to creations of the mind, such as inventions and artistic works <a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>.</span> Intellectual property rights allow individuals to protect their work by preventing others from reproducing or exploiting their intellectual creations <a href="#footnote-2">[2]</a>. Forms of intellectual property include copyright, patent, and trademark <a href="#footnote-2">[2]</a>. We’re focusing on copyright here. Copyright is the body of law that deals with the ownership and use of works such as software, architecture, art, and music <a href="#footnote-3">[3]</a>.</span>

				<p>Copyright laws “promote the progress of science and useful arts . . .” <a href="#footnote-4">[4]</a> because they incentivize people to develop new intellectual property. Copyright law protects artistic labor by creating a boundary around what work creators can guard through legal protections. In this way, copyright law promotes innovation because artists know they can be paid for their protected work. The basic purpose of copyright is to “enrich our society's wealth of culture and information” <a href="#footnote-3">[3]</a>.</p>


				<br>
				<h3>Copyright is different from Copyright Registration</h3>
				<p>Copyright is established as soon as your expressive work is complete, but registering a copyright gives your work special legal protections.</p>

				<h4>Copyright Upon Fixation</h4>
				<span class="blue">The right to register a work for copyright</span>

				<p>Today, creators earn a copyright upon fixation after completing their work <a href="#footnote-7">[7]</a>. Creators’ works are automatically copyrighted upon <span class="blue">“fixation”</span><a href="#footnote-8">[8]</a>. To qualify for fixation, a work must be:</p>

				<ol>
					<li>fixed in a tangible medium of expression (e.g. a musical work on a record),</li>
					<li>perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated, either directly or with the aid of a machine or device <a href="#footnote-8">[8]</a>.</li>
				</ol>

				<p>Thinking back to the landscape painting example—the work is fixed as soon as you finish the painting. At that moment, you earn a copyright over the work.</p>

				<p>With fixation, you gain the right to register for a copyright of your work. Copyright gives you the legal right to exclude others, but you can't defend your work by suing until you register. This is why the U.S. Copyright Office recommends that creators still register their work for copyright to publicly record their ownership status <a href="#footnote-9">[9]</a>.</p>
				

				
				<h4>Registered Copyright</h4>
				<span class="blue">The right to legally defend your work</span>
				
				<p>Unlike copyrights upon fixation, <span class="blue">copyright registration creates legal benefits. You cannot bring a claim or litigate an issue of copyright without registering your copyright <a href="#footnote-10">[10]</a></span>. Upon fixation, you gain the right to register for copyright, but you do not necessarily earn the right to defend your copyright legally without registration. You must have a registered copyright to bring infringement claims and seek monetary relief through the legal system. This is the key distinction between copyright and a registered copyright.</p>

				<br>
				<h4>How do you register for a copyright?</h4>
				<p>Applying for registration requires an application, a filing fee ($65), and a copy of the work (which the Office calls a “deposit”) <a href="#footnote-11">[11]</a>, <a href="#footnote-6">[6]</a>. Once again, you can copyright many different forms of art. These forms of art include digital art (like photography), physical art (like painting or sculpture), and musical works (like musical composition). Once you have a registered copyright, you can bring a claim against another party at the CCB or federal court. The CCB importantly requires you to have a registered or pending copyright to bring infringement claims. Before looking at how to bring a claim at the CCB, let’s look more closely at some terms you may want to familiarize yourself.</p>
				<br>

				<div class="box">
					<div class="box-subtitle">Copyright at a glance</div>
						<ul>
							<li>Works gain copyrights once they are "fixed" in a tangible expressive medium.</li>
							<li>Copyrights alone do not create legal rights.</li>
							<li>Registered copyrights establish legal rights - when a work with a registered copyright is infringed, you can defend your rights in the legal system.</li>
							<li>You are required to have copyright registration or pending copyright registration for works you seek to defend with infringement claims with the CCB.</li>

				<h1>What is the Copyright Claims Board (CCB)?</h1>

					<p>In December 2020, the Copyright Alternative in Small-Claims Enforcement Act of 2020 (CASE Act) gave the Copyright Office the power to establish the Copyright Claims Board (called the “CCB”) <a href="#footnote-12">[12]</a>. The CCB was established by the federal government with the goal of expanding “access to justice” making “the copyright system as understandable and accessible to as many members of the public as possible.” <a href="#footnote-13">[13]</a></p>

					<p>The Copyright Office’s approach to resolving copyright disputes online is the CCB. Three presiding officers, each with deep expertise in copyright law, make case determinations and lead the CCB. Court hearings and proceedings are conducted <span class="blue">fully online</span>, reducing the barrier to entry that can occur when proceedings occur in court. The CCB is designed for claimants to navigate without an attorney, though you are welcome to hire one. Although litigants can represent themselves in federal court, some may find this easier in the CCB’s claim process. </p>

					<p>The CCB sees all kinds of copyright cases. As of 2023, the most common claims were for pictorial, graphic, or sculptural works.</p>

				<br>
				<img src="assets/CCB-pie-chart.svg" alt="A pie chart showing the distribution of types of work represented in CCB claims between 6/16/2022 to 10/31/2022" />
				<div class="caption">This chart is based on data provided by the Library of Congress <a href="#footnote-14">[14]</a>.</div>
				<br>
								
				<p>Unlike federal court, the CCB’s <span class="blue">jurisdiction is limited</span> to claims for copyright infringement, noninfringement, and misrepresentation in situations involving notices sent under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) <a href="#footnote-15">[15]</a>, <a href="#footnote-16">[16]</a>.</p> 

				<p><span class="blue">Notably, participation in the CCB is also fully voluntary.</span> While a claimant (the person who brings the claim to the CCB) may raise a valid argument, a respondent (the person who responds to the claim) can decide whether to participate in CCB proceedings (more on this later). If a respondent chooses to opt out, a claimant can still bring a lawsuit against that respondent in federal court. </p>

				<p>A respondent can also file a counterclaim, or a claim rebutting the claimant’s original claim. If a respondent files a counterclaim, it must be related to the original claim. Counterclaims are also limited to the types of claims in the CCB’s jurisdiction and must arise from the same “transaction or occurrence” (the same facts and circumstances) as the original claim. </p>
				
				<p>Neither party can bring a claim before the CCB seeking more than $30,000 in
				total damages (more on this later, as well!).</p>

				<h2>Could the CCB be right for you?</h2>
				<p>The CCB is one among a few options you have to legally defend your intellectual property. The CCB's process is different from that of federal courts, and comes with its own eligibility requirements. </p>
				<img src="assets/CCB-flowchart.svg" alt="a flowchart of questions stepping through considerations a person might have when considering bringing a claim with the CCB" />
			</div>

			<div class="section"  id="ccb-tradeoffs">
				<h2>What are the tradeoffs of filing with the CCB?</h2>
				<p>There are some advantages and disadvantages to filing with the CCB as opposed to filing in federal court. Consider the following when you consider your claim:</p>
				<h4>👍 ADVANTAGES</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>There is no attorney required.
						<ul>
							<li>You can avoid attorney’s fees by filing with the CCB.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>The CCB is a more approachable court system.
					<ul>
						<li>The CCB is entirely online, and there are some advantages to a digital court system. The CCB’s online forms have text boxes for input information.</li>
						<li>The online forms will help you figure out the information you need to file a claim and navigate court proceedings.</li>
					</ul></li>
					<li>There is a low filing fee—filing your claim and proceedings to an active case require $40 and $60, respectively.</li>
					<li>The administration is fully remote, negotiating travel costs and conflicts with other commitments.</li>
					<li>Decisions are made by a panel of experts on copyright who focus primarily on these cases.</li>
				</ul>

				<h4>👎 DISADVANTAGES</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>There is no attorney required.
					<ul>
						<li>Filing alone can sometimes be confusing, and it is important to remember that you need enough evidence to support a viable claim. This can be easier with the help of an attorney who can guide you through the process. Remember that you can also file with the CCB with an attorney.</li>
					</ul></li>
					<li>Damages are limited to $30,000 per proceeding.</li>
					<li>Respondents may not agree to litigate via the CCB.</li>
					<li>Evidence to support your claim must be captured digitally.
					<ul>
						<li>To create a compelling claim, you need to capture all your communications and images digitally and in a format that will help the CCB officers assess your claim.</li>
					</ul></li>
				</ul>
			</div>

			<div class="section" id="ccb-eligibility">
				<h2>Is your claim eligible for the CCB?</h2>
				<p>Filing a successful claim with the CCB may not be as easy as it seems. Review the list below to determine if the CCB is right for you. All the following must be true for you to be eligible to bring a claim, in general:Filing a successful claim with the CCB may not be as easy as it seems. Review the list below to determine if the CCB is right for you. All the following must be true for you to be eligible to bring a claim, in general:</p>


				<ul class="checkbox-list">
					<li><input type="checkbox" checked>You and your respondent live in the United States.<br>

						<span class="blue">Note: Respondents can opt out of CCB proceedings. If they opt out, you can refile in federal court either by yourself (as a pro se litigant) or with an attorney.</span>
					</li>
				</ul>
				

				<h4>DAMAGES & SETTLEMENTS</h4>
				<p>When you file a claim, you’ll need to indicate the compensation you are owed. The list below summarizes some issues to consider:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>The CCB only allows for actual or statutory damages. If you think you have a better chance of seeking higher damages in federal court, then the CCB may not be your best option.</li>
					<li>If you are seeking damages under $5,000, you may want to consider filing under a simplified CCB “Smaller Claims” track. This track will involve only one presiding officer, who plays a more prominent role in the case. The CCB published a helpful table highlighting the key differences between this track and the default track in its handbook for <a target="_blank" href="https://ccb.gov/handbook/Smaller-Claims.pdf">Smaller Claims (Page 3)</a>.</li>
					<li>A claimant bringing an infringement claim can seek an award of actual damages and the infringer’s profits, statutory damages, or no damages. The claimant must choose which type of awards they are seeking before the Board makes its final determination, and they should do this no later than when the claimant submits their written testimony in the proceeding. Statutory damages are capped at $15,000 per infringed work (not per infringement) or $7,500 if the work wasn’t registered in a timely manner (as described below under “Statutory Damages”).  For more information on damages, <a target="_blank" href="https://ccb.gov/handbook/Damages.pdf">see the CCB book on statutory damages.</a></li>
					<li>If you choose to participate in CCB-facilitated settlement discussions, a Copyright Claims Officer other than the one handling the day-to-day aspects of the proceeding will be assigned to assist you at a settlement conference. For more information on settlements, see the <a target="_blank" href="https://ccb.gov/handbook/Settlement.pdf">CCB handbook on settlements (Page 4)</a>.</li>
				</ul>

						<td class="terminology-definition">
							You may have an infringement claim if you believe that someone used your original and protected work. To bring a CCB infringement claim, you must (1) have a registered copyright for your work, (2) maintain exclusive rights over the work, and (3) someone else attempted to use your exclusive rights without your permission.<br><br>
							<span class="blue">Example: You independently released a song (this is fixation) on SoundCloud a few years ago and registered it for copyright protection with the US Copyright Office.

							These claims are relevant if someone accuses you of unlawfully using or intending to use their protected work without permission. A noninfringement claim can give you a declaration from the CCB that your conduct is not (nor will be) copyright infringement. You do not need a registered copyright to bring a noninfringement claim.<br><br>
							<span class="blue">Example: You wrote a play about a farmer’s plight that will soon be performed at a local theater and have not yet registered your work with the Copyright Office. Another playwright famous for a show related to farming found out and asked you to cancel the performances. In conversations with others, they accused you of copyright infringement.

				<div class="ccb-stage-collapsible-content" id="ccb-stage-2">					
					<p>After you file a claim, a few things need to happen before the respondent is made aware of your claim. The CCB will review your claim to make sure it complies with the Copyright Claims Act, to which the CCB is bound, and follows CCB’s policies. Your claim must also be substantial enough for a respondent to answer. Many cases do not make it past compliance review. The CCB might review your filing for the following:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Does your case present a copyright issue relevant to the CCB’s scope?<ol>
							<li>The CCB mentions in its guidance that cases that are fundamentally about contractual disagreements are not within scope SOURCE: compliance review handbook p3</li></ol>
							<li>Is your <a href="#ccb-eligibility">claim eligible?</a></li>
							<li>Are you asking for the kind of relief that the CCB can provide?<ol>
								<li>The damages you seek do not exceed $30,000.</li>
								<li>You are not asking the CCB to issue an injunction.</li>
								<li>If you are filing a noninfringement claim, you are not requesting monetary relief.</li>
							</ol></li>
							<li>Did you provide a detailed “statement of material facts”? (More on this below!)</li>
							<li>Is the party necessary to the proceeding available?</li>
						</li>
					</ol>
					<p>If your claim passes compliance review, the CCB will issue a Notice of Compliance and Direction to Serve, taking you to the next step. If not, you will be notified about what is missing in your filing and have 30 days to amend it. If the amended claim still does not pass compliance after a second look, you will have one more opportunity to amend and refile within 30 days.</p>
					<p>If this claim does not pass compliance review at this point, the CCB will dismiss your case without prejudice, but you can still re-file the same claim in the future. This means you can re-submit your claim to the CCB, and it will be considered again if you submit a new claim.</p>

				<div class="ccb-stage-collapsible-content" id="ccb-stage-3">
					<p>The CCB will provide you with a packet of information you must present to the respondent. You cannot include any other materials when sending this packet. Proper service includes an initial notice, the claim, and the opt-out form.</p>
					<p>Presenting the respondent with the materials means that you have served the respondent. Importantly, you cannot serve the respondent yourself. A general rule to keep in mind is that if you are serving in person, you may not personally serve the documents. Only a person who is not a party to the proceeding can, and they must be over the age of eighteen.</p>
					<p>Once you issue service, you will need to share evidence of service with the CCB within seven days of service. You have 90 days to issue service and file proof of service. Service can be challenging in the filing process because each state has its own service rules. It may be difficult for some participants to begin the process digitally but remember that service needs to be done in person and over mail. How service is accomplished will depend “on who the respondent is, where they are located, and whether they have a designated service agent.” The CCB advises that some claimants may want to consider hiring a process server who can sign a form confirming the service of the process.</p>
					<p>You can issue service by the CCB’s designated methods or serve based on the applicable state law where the respondent lives. You can also give your respondent the option to waive service. If the respondent agrees to waive, you do not need to serve them. For more on how to serve respondents, visit the CCB’s service recommendations at SOURCE.</p>

					<p>A determination concludes an active proceeding and explains the basis for the CCB’s decision. The CCB’s determination of your claim is called the “final determination,” but if you aren’t satisfied with a determination, you can seek reconsideration by the CCB, and if that is denied, you may request a review by the Register of Copyrights. You do not need an attorney for any of these proceedings.</p>
					<p>A CCB determination is the CCB’s decision as to who wins the case and the damages to award, if any. It is in writing and includes an explanation of the facts and laws the CCB relied on to make the decision. Importantly, if the losing party does not comply with the determination, it can be enforced in federal court.</p>
					<p>After a determination or an amended determination, each party has thirty days to submit a request to the CCB to reconsider or modify its determination. There is no filing fee for that request. When a request for reconsideration is made, the other parties have thirty days to file a response. Requests for reconsideration cannot be filed by a respondent or counterclaim respondent who defaulted and did not respond to the CCB’s proposed default determination (which would turn the proposed default determination into a final determination).</p>

				<h2>What makes a claim strong?</h2>
				<p>While the CCB’s filing forms will guide you through this process, there are some fields that you may want to consider more carefully. The strength of your claim is generally evaluated based on whether you can prove each element of that claim – <span class="blue">you must satisfy all the elements of the claim</span> to prevail in your case. The CCB’s presiding officers will look at the evidence submitted and your argument to determine whether you have satisfied these elements. Even when describing your claim in your initial filing, you may want to show the CCB officers <span class="blue">that you will later be able to prove the essential elements of your copyright claim</span> <a href="#footnote-20">[20]</a>. Remember to answer these questions about how you can support each element when drafting a claim.</p>

				<h4>Noninfringement Claims</h4>
				
				<p>You may bring a noninfringement claim if the respondent accused you of infringing on their work, but you disagree and want to legally establish that your conduct does not establish infringement. Noninfringement claims are very similar to infringement claims, but with one key difference: you need to prove that you and the respondent are in a genuine dispute over whether there is infringement. If you can prove a dispute, the respondent will need to prove every element of infringement outlined above. </p>

				<h4>Misrepresentation Claims</h4>
				<p>You can bring a claim of misrepresentation before the CCB “if you believe the respondent said something false in a takedown notice or counter-notice to an online service provider, and this resulted in the online service provider taking content offline or putting it back online.” Review the following examples of evidence to try to build a strong claim:</p>

				<h2>Special Considerations: Generative AI</h2>
					<p>Copyright has changed dramatically with new technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Nonfungible Tokens (NFTs). Because AI can easily copy the work of another source, and NFTs are intangible goods that can easily be copied, these technologies raise new copyright law issues.</p>
					<p>If you feel that any of these technologies have infringed on your work or choose to use them in your work, you might want to consider a few things before bringing your claim to the CCB. This area of the law is evolving and subject to change.</p>

					<h4>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE & ART</h4>

					<p>Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) models, like those powering DALL-E, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion, are trained on images from all over the Internet. If you have posted images of your art online, AI tools have likely used these images to develop and create new images. AI thus creates two main copyright issues: inputs and outputs. Creators have argued that both AI inputs and outputs raise copyright issues.</p>

					<p><strong>Inputs •</strong> Because AI trains on images publicly available on the Internet, generative AI systems can learn from images in their training process. As a creator, you may worry that your protected work was used to enrich one of these models.</p>

					<p><strong>Outputs •</strong> AI can also generate images that appear substantially like an existing work or a creator’s unique art style. By training on existing images, generative AI borrows from pre-existing works.</p>

					<p>If you see an image from AI that looks like a work you created, you may feel that the AI tool infringed your copyright. In our current copyright climate, AI developers may argue that AI-based images are “fair use” and do not infringe copyright protection <a href="#footnote-23">[23]</a>. Whether or not you can bring a claim of copyright infringement against an AI tool that generated an image like your own or used your image to generate a new image is still up for debate.</p>

					<br><br>

					<p><strong>Can you own copyrights for works that you used GAI models to create?</strong></p>
					<br>
					<p>If you used AI to create a new artwork or a portion of an artwork, whether you can claim copyright for your work depends on a variety of factors. The Copyright Office’s current position is that only human creators can earn copyright protection. AI (or even an animal!) creators are therefore excluded from protection <a href="#footnote-32">[32]</a>, <a href="#footnote-23">[23]</a>. “When an AI technology determines the expressive elements of its output, the generated material is not the product of human authorship. As a result, that material is not protected by copyright and must be disclaimed in a registration application” <a href="#footnote-33">[33]</a>.</p>

					<p>On the other hand, in the case of works “containing AI-generated material, “the Office will consider whether the AI contributions are the result of ‘mechanical reproduction’ or instead of an author's “own original mental conception, to which [the author] gave visible form” <a href="#footnote-33">[33]</a>. In this sense, whether your AI work can earn copyright protection is a case-by-case inquiry <a href="#footnote-33">[33]</a>. The work must have sufficient human input to constitute human authorship and, consequently, copyright protections. For example, “a human may select or arrange AIgenerated material in a sufficiently creative way that “the resulting work as a whole constitutes an original work of authorship” <a href="#footnote-33">[33]</a>. In sum, whether you can earn copyright protection for a work with partial AI influence will depend on how much AI was used in your work and how you used AI in your creative process. Simply inputting a prompt into an AI generator tool to create an image is probably not enough to earn authorship rights.</p>

					<br><br>

					<p><strong>Can AI models own copyrights to the works that they are used to create?</strong></p>

					<p>It is “well established” that copyright can only protect work created by human authors <a href="#footnote-33">[33]</a>. AI models are not human and cannot own copyright rights <a href="#footnote-32">[32]</a>, <a href="#footnote-23">[23]</a> based on the Copyright Office’s current policy. While the current copyright landscape for AI may be lagging the pace of AI development, it is important to remember that the Copyright Office has adapted many policies over the 20th and 21st centuries to accommodate new forms of technology. It may only be a matter of years before the Office begins to recognize AI’s impact on copyright law. One of the issues for the office may be  the confluence of ideas and expression. For example, does a creator own the text they input into an AI image generator? It is important to remember, as well, that the amount of original expression within a work can determine copyright outcomes. If cases continue to raise issues related to AI and copyright, the office might reconsider how AI is interpreted.</p>

					<h4>NFTS & THE BLOCKCHAIN</h4>

					<p>Like AI art, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) invoke complicated copyright questions. NFTs allow creators to introduce artistic images onto the blockchain, seamlessly transferring ownership to an NFT. This seamless transfer of ownership also poses new challenges. Because of the blockchain’s decentralized design, when creators transfer NFTs to others, they must also transfer a “key” to the block holding the NFT. Once a buyer has this key, they technically own the NFT but may not own the copyright. An NFT creator must separately transfer the copyright ownership to a buyer to give them the rights associated with the copyright. As an NFT creator, it is your choice whether you want to transfer the exclusive rights that come with a registered copyright to a buyer. </p>

					<p>If an NFT buyer uses an image in ways that exceed their rights (for example, if they do not own the copyright), you may want to bring an infringement claim. Ownership “over the intellectual property of an NFT is not always clearly defined” <a href="#footnote-34">[34]</a>. When an NFT is minted or sold, “a blockchain’s smart contract will automatically execute the transfer of ownership, including any rules applicable to the NFT like terms of purchase or resale opportunities” <a href="#footnote-34">[34]</a>. This “often means that when an NFT is traded, a license that informs collectors about what they can and can’t do with their new asset goes along with it” <a href="#footnote-34">[34]</a>. As legal scholars James Grimmelmann, Yan Ji, and Tyler Kell claim: </p>

						<p class="quote-block">"If you buy an oil painting from an artist, you don’t also receive ownership of the copyright. Yes, you own the original, but the artist retains the copyright, and they can sell prints of it if they like. If you want to buy the copyright too, you’ll need to get a separate agreement. The same is true for NFTs. Unless an NFT explicitly gives owners copyright interests as opposed to just access to the artwork, owners should not assume that they have any rights to use the artwork or to stop others from using it <a href="#footnote-35">[35]</a>."</p>

					<p>Individuals who plan to sell NFT artwork should also consider whether they also intend to sell the copyright protecting their artwork. They might want to only give buyers of their NFT the rights to use and display, but not their NFT, for example. </p>

					<p>If you are the creator of an NFT, and you sold your work, you need to remember that the sale of your work does not automatically transfer copyrights. When selling your NFT, be sure to think about whether you want to sell the copyright too and, if you do, to include that in your sale. Once again, simply because your NFT was sold does not necessarily give buyers the right to copy your work. </p>
