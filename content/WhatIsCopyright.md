## What is copyright?

Imagine you spend hours painting a beautiful landscape—after weeks of work, you upload an image of your painting to share with the world in your online portfolio. A few days later, you see a copy of your painting sold as a print on an online marketplace. Have your intellectual property rights been violated?

Intellectual property refers to creations of the mind, such as inventions and artistic works [ ]. Intellectual property rights allow individuals to protect their work by preventing others from reproducing or exploiting their intellectual creations [ ]. Intellectual property rights include copyrights, patents, trademarks, and design rights [2]. We’re focusing on copyright here.

Copyright is “the body of law that deals with the ownership and use of works of literature, music, and art.”[ ] The basic purpose of copyright is to “enrich our society's wealth of culture and information.”[3] Congress draws power from the US Constitution to enact copyright laws to “promote the progress of science and useful arts[.]”[ ] Because more than one person can share intellectual property simultaneously, copyright law helps protect artistic labor by creating a boundary around what is and isn’t for the artist to own. In this way, copyright law promotes innovation because artists know they can be paid for their work. Copyrights eventually expire if not renewed, returning works to the public domain [20].  



### Copyright is different from Copyright Registration 

Copyright is established as soon as your expressive work is complete, but registering a copyright gives your work special legal protections.

#### Copyright Upon Fixation
The right to register a work for copyright
Today, creators earn a copyright upon fixation after completing their work.  Creators’ works are automatically copyrighted upon “fixation” [ ]. To qualify for fixation, a work must be:
(1)	fixed in a tangible medium of expression (e.g. a musical work on a record),
(2)	perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated, either directly or with the aid of a machine or device [5].
Thinking back to the landscape painting example—the work is fixed as soon as you finish the painting. At that moment, you earn a copyright over the work.
With fixation, you gain the right to register for a copyright to protect it. Beyond that, copyrights alone do not establish legal protections. This is why the U.S. Copyright Office recommends that creators still register their work for copyright to publicly record their ownership status [ ].

#### Copyright Registration
The right to legally defend your work
Unlike copyrights upon fixation, copyright registration creates legal benefits.   You cannot bring a claim or litigate an issue of copyright without registering your copyright.  Upon fixation, you gain the right to register for copyright, but you do not necessarily earn the right to defend your copyright legally without registration. You must have a registered copyright to bring infringement claims and seek monetary relief through the legal system. This is the key distinction between copyright and copyright registration [6].

#### How do you register for a copyright? 
Applying for registration requires an application, a filing fee ($65), and a copy of the work (which the Office calls a “deposit”) [ ], [22]. You can bring a claim by filing a complaint to a federal court or by filing your claim online with the Copyright Claims Board. Once again, you can copyright many different forms of art. These forms of art include digital art (like photography), physical art (like painting or sculpture), and musical works (like musical composition). Before looking at how to bring a claim at the CCB, let’s look more closely at some terms you may want to familiarize yourself.
