## Getting started
To download this repository locally, you'll need copy it locally:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Center-for-Cultural-Innovation/ccb-creator-guide.git
```

To compile and run this locally, navigate to your repository in your terminal and enter the following:
```bash
python3 -m http.server
```

Though this may vary depending on your local environment settings, you will likely see the following in your terminal:
```bash
Serving HTTP on :: port 8000 (http://[::]:8000/) ...
::1 - - [dd/M/YYYY HH:MM:SS] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 -
::1 - - [dd/M/YYYY HH:MM:SS] "GET file..." 200 -
::1 - - [dd/M/YYYY HH:MM:SS] "GET file..." 200 -
::1 - - [dd/M/YYYY HH:MM:SS] "GET file..." 200 -
::1 - - [dd/M/YYYY HH:MM:SS] "GET file..." 200 -
```

Your website should now be served at the following link:
[http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/)

As you update your code locally, those updates should become nearly immediately available on your locally hosted web version. 

Remember to keep these docs up to you date if you make any major changes, and happy coding!
